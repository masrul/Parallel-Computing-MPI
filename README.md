## Parallel Computing Using Message Passing Interface (MPI) 

This repository contains the projects that I completed while participating in **Design of Parallel Algorithms** for my Minor in CS. It has three sub-repositories, 

+ Communication
> Implementation of different collective communication models 
&nbsp;
+ Dynamic-Load-Balancing
> Implementation Master/Worker model using dynamic chunk sizes. 
&nbsp;
+ Parallel-Sorting 
> Implementation of parallel quick and bitonic sort
